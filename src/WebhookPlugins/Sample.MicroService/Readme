For debugging create the local.settings.json and add the following and anything else that 
would need in your development environment but should not be pushed into the repository.

{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet"
  }
}

The local.settings.json has been added in the .gitignore file to be ignored by Git commits

The following command has been added in the Startup.cs 

.AddJsonFile(Path.Combine(context.ApplicationRootPath, "local.settings.json"), optional: true, reloadOnChange: true)
